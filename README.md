## Discord linked roles light API

###### Abbreviations used: Discord linked roles = DLR

This repository is a very lightweight python client for creating custom Discord connections and linked roles. It is based on [official documentation](https://discord.com/developers/docs/tutorials/configuring-app-metadata-for-linked-roles) and [example](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/linked-role-discord-bot) provided by Discord team. DLR and Connections allow you to link any game or web resource with Discord account and see in-game(web resource) nickname and statistics inside Discord in user profile (same as twitter, youtube, twitch and other Connections already existing officially). [Detailed description](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/8063233404823-Connections-Linked-Roles-Community-Members).
